"""
Messages API Blueprint.

Educational Note: This blueprint handles the core AI interaction - sending
messages to Claude and receiving responses. This is where the RAG pipeline
and tool-use loop happens (delegated to main_chat_service).

The message flow:
1. User sends message via POST endpoint
2. main_chat_service builds context (sources, memory, system prompt)
3. Claude API is called with tools (search_sources, store_memory)
4. Tool use loop executes until Claude returns final response
5. Both user message and assistant response are stored and returned
