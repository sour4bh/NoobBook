Project cost tracking endpoint.

Educational Note: Cost tracking is essential for LLM applications because:

1. API calls cost real money - Claude, OpenAI, etc. charge per token
2. Different models have different costs:
   - Sonnet: $3/1M input, $15/1M output tokens
   - Haiku: $1/1M input, $5/1M output tokens
3. Projects can vary wildly in cost based on:
   - Number of sources (affects system prompt size)
   - Chat frequency
   - Source processing (PDF extraction uses many tokens)

Cost Tracking Architecture:
- Each claude_service.send_message() call records usage
- Costs stored in Supabase projects.costs column
- Broken down by model for transparency

This helps users understand:
- Which projects consume the most API credits
- Whether to use cheaper models for certain tasks
- Budget planning for production deployments

Routes:
- GET /projects/<id>/costs - Get cost breakdown for project

    Get cost tracking data for a project.

    Educational Note: This endpoint provides transparency about API usage.
    In production apps, this data helps with:
    - Billing users accurately
    - Setting usage quotas
    - Identifying expensive operations to optimize
