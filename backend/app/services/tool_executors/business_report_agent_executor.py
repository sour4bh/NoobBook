"""
Business Report Agent Executor - Handles studio signal execution for business reports.

Educational Note: This executor is triggered by studio signals (from main chat)
and launches the business_report_agent as a background task. The agent orchestrates
data analysis (via csv_analyzer_agent) and report writing.

The key difference from other executors is that business reports can analyze
multiple CSV sources and incorporate context from non-CSV sources.

    Executor for business report generation via studio signals.

    Educational Note: The studio signal flow:
    1. User chats with AI about sources (including CSV data)

    3. studio_signal_executor routes to this executor
