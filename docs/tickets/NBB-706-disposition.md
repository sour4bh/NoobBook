# NBB-706 Suffix-Drift Disposition Inventory

Audit of every `*Service` and `*Executor` class in `backend/app/` against
the NBB-706 Keep-as-class list, the seven stateless conversion targets,
and any holdouts that an upstream ticket missed. Required deliverable per
NBB-706 AC#3.

Disposition values:
- `KEEP` — legitimate exception per NBB-706 Keep-as-class list (provider,
  store, orchestration). Stateful or has explicit platform contract.
- `CONVERTED-IN-NBB-706` — converted in this ticket per the seven-row
  stateless conversion map.
- `HOLDOUT` — should have been converted upstream; if the blast radius is
  small enough this ticket fixes it manually, otherwise the upstream
  owner is named.

## Summary

- Total classes in inventory: 43 (34 *Service + 9 *Executor).
- KEEP: 37 (28 *Service + 9 *Executor).
- CONVERTED-IN-NBB-706 (matched by the *Service grep): 6 — `ChatNamingService`,
  `EmbeddingService`, `SummaryService`, `ValidationService`, `VideoPromptService`,
  and `OpenAIService`.
- HOLDOUTS: 0.
- The seventh NBB-706 conversion target (`SupabaseClient`) carries a `Client`
  suffix and is invisible to the inventory greps. It is logged in the
  Supplemental row below for completeness.

## Supplemental: non-suffix class also converted in NBB-706

| Path | Class | Disposition | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| backend/app/services/integrations/supabase/supabase_client.py | SupabaseClient | CONVERTED-IN-NBB-706 | Row 1: class deleted; `get_client()`, `is_configured()`, `reset()` exposed as module functions; `_client`, `_initialized` preserved as module-private state. |

The 43 inventory rows above cover the AC#3 deliverable; SupabaseClient is logged here for completeness because the seventh conversion target uses a `Client` suffix instead of `Service` and would be missed by the inventory greps.
